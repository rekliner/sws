This fork exists only because I'm job searching.  If someone is reviewing my code please see https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/commit/c3e63f02cf27e198ed2c49cc7ac319b8a5f116f7 for most of my contributions to the SWS project.
That said I may help out with sws again someday, I was happy to contribute, but for now I've switched to Ableton as my main DAW.

SWS Extension

The SWS extension is a collection of features that seamlessly integrate into REAPER, the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software by Cockos, Inc.

For more information on the capabilities of the SWS extension or to download it, please visit the end-user website http://www.sws-extension.org.
For more information on REAPER itself or to download the latest version, go to http://www.reaper.fm.

You are welcome to contribute! Just fork the repo and send us a pull request on the 'next' branch. For building details see https://github.com/Jeff0S/sws/wiki/Building-the-SWS-Extension.

While not strictly required by the license, if you use the code in your own project we would like definitely like to hear from you.


The SWS extension includes the following 3rd party libraries (which are all similarly licensed):

* OscPkt http://gruntthepeon.free.fr/oscpkt/
* TagLib http://taglib.github.io/
* libebur128 https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128


The SWS extension also relies on WDL from Cockos http://www.cockos.com/wdl (not included).
